# C++ Programming For Science - Lab 5

This template repository is the starter project for C++ Programming For Science Lab 5. Written in C++, and tested with CMake/Catch2.

### Question(s)

1.  Write a C++ function that returns the sum of all elements in a one-dimensional array.

2. Write a C++ function that finds and returns the maximum element in a two-dimensional array. Assume a maximum column size of 100 for simplicity.

3. Write a C++ function that calculates the sum of the elements on the main diagonal of a square two-dimensional array.

4. Write a C++ function that searches for a target value in a one-dimensional array and returns its index. If the target is not found, return `-1`. Use Binary Search to achieve the result.

5. Write a C++ function that transposes a two-dimensional array. This means that the output array's rows and columns are swapped from the input array.
